Hi, I'm pruce.I’m an undergraduate student at the School of Foreign Languages, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, majoring in English Linguistics with plans to graduate in 2026. 

I’ve always been driven by a mysterious force to understand the world from diverse perspectives. I find learning maths and computer science enjoyable, and I maintain an extremely open-minded attitude towards various fields, but my favorites are still economics and business.

I consider myself an ordinary student, but I love engaging in activities that are fun, helpful to others, or intellectually stimulating. Overall, I’m very happy with how things are going.
