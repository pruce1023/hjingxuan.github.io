I’m an undergraduate student at the School of Foreign Languages, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, majoring in English Linguistics with plans to graduate in 2026. I’ve always been driven by a mysterious force to understand the world from diverse perspectives. I find learning math and computer science enjoyable, and I have a wide range of interests in various subjects, but my favorites are economics and business. I consider myself an ordinary student, but I love engaging in activities that are fun, helpful to others, or intellectually stimulating. Overall, I’m very happy with how things are going.
